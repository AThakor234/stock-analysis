## Overview of the Project

Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren't adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient - by taking fewer steps,using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.

In this project, we are going to analyze green energy stocks, in addition to DAQO, for the years 2017 and 2018. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this analyze is to compare the original code and the refactored one in order to find out if refactoring the code will successfully maka the VBA script run faster.

## Analysis of Data and Results

When we run the original code, we get the following stock analysis outputs for the year 2017 and 2018:
